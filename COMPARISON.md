# idemkit vs prior art

A side-by-side of `idemkit` and the other Go libraries / sample projects that try to do HTTP idempotency. Last surveyed May 2026.

## Column meaning

- **Body-hash fingerprint** — does the library include the request body in the cache-key identity? Without it, two requests with the same `Idempotency-Key` but different bodies share a cache entry, which is unsafe.
- **Wait for in-progress** — when a duplicate request arrives while the first is still running, does the second wait and replay, or fail / race? Stripe-style semantics require waiting.
- **Postgres / Redis / In-memory** — which backends are supported. `idemkit` ships in-mem in v0.1, Postgres in v0.2, Redis in v0.3.
- **Framework-agnostic** — works with `net/http` directly (so any framework that accepts `http.Handler` adapters can use it). Framework-locked libraries can't be used from outside their ecosystem.
- **Streaming safe-skip** — does the library detect `http.Flusher.Flush()` and skip caching for streaming endpoints? This is the silent foot-gun every implementation should handle but most don't.

## When to use each

**Pick [`velmie/idempo`](https://github.com/velmie/idempo) if:** you need Redis today, you don't need Postgres, and you want fewer abstractions. It's smaller, has shipped, and the body-hash + wait semantics are correct.

**Pick `idemkit` (when v0.2 lands) if:** you need a Postgres backend, want selectable conflict semantics (Stripe vs IETF), or value the streaming safe-skip and explicit threat-model documentation.

**Pick `Fiber middleware` if:** you're already using Fiber. Don't trust it for anything that requires body-hash semantics — it doesn't compare bodies.

**Pick `idemgotent`, `furkandeveloper/idempotency-middleware`, or `go-mizu/idempotency` if:** you're already using their framework AND don't need body-hash semantics. These libraries assume the idempotency key alone is enough, which is true only when clients always send the same body with the same key.

**Don't pick `dhanapala-id/go-kit`** unless you're already using their internal stack. The 409-fail-fast behavior on concurrent duplicates is wrong for most use cases — clients usually want to wait and retry.

**`go-rocket-ride` is a sample app** for Brandur's 2017 blog post, not a library. Reference it for the architecture, don't depend on it.
